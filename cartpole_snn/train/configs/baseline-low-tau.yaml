# Baseline configuration for SNN-DQN on CartPole-v1
# This config has lower tau value than the baseline
# NOTE: Failed to match baseline performance in testing

training:
  batch_size: 128 # Transitions sampled from replay buffer
  gamma: 0.99 # Discount factor for future rewards
  eps_start: 0.9 # Starting exploration rate
  eps_end: 0.01 # Minimum exploration rate
  # eps_decay controls the rate of exponential decay of epsilon
  # - If set too low, the agent may not explore enough and get stuck in suboptimal policies
  eps_decay: 2500 # Epsilon decay rate (higher = slower decay, longer exploration)
  # LOWERED TAU VALUE from baseline
  tau: 0.001 # Target network soft update rate
  lr: 0.0003 # AdamW learning rate (3e-4)
  num_episodes: 600 # Total training episodes

snn:
  num_steps: 30 # SNN simulation timesteps per environment step
  beta: 0.9 # LIF neuron membrane decay rate
  surrogate_gradient_slope: 25 # Slope for fast_sigmoid surrogate gradient
  neuron_type: leaky # Neuron type: 'leaky' or 'leakysv'
  hidden1_size: 128 # Neurons in first hidden layer
  hidden2_size: 128 # Neurons in second hidden layer
